# OSM_Route_Planner
In this project, we will write a program in C++ using real map data and A* search to find a path between two points, just as we might see in a desktop or mobile mapping application. The project will be using data from the [**OpenStreetMap project**](https://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=6/46.449/2.210).
